            <h3>A short Biography of Lata Mangeshker</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mangeshkar was born in a Maharashtrian Brahmin family in 1929, the eldest daughter of Deenanath
                    Mangeshkar.</li>
                <li>a Marathi and Konkani musician, and his wife Shevanti in Indore (in the present-day</li>
                <li> Indore district of Madhya Pradesh and then the capital of the princely state of Indore
                <li> which was part of the Central India Agency in British India).
                <li> Her father, Deenanath Mangeshkar, was a classical singer and theatre actor.
                <li>Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), a Gujarati woman from Thalner, Bombay Presidency
                    (now in northwest Maharashtra)</li>
                <li>was Deenanath's second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died, was Shevanti's older sister.</li>
                <li>Her paternal grandfather, Ganesh Bhatt Navathe Hardikar (Abhisheki), was a priest who performed</li>
                <li>the abhishekam of the Shiva lingam at the Mangueshi Temple in Goa.</li>
                <li>Her paternal grandmother, Yesubai Rane, was from Goa.</li>
                <li>Her maternal grandfather, Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, was from Gujarat, a prosperous businessman and
                    landlord of Thalner.
                <li> She learned Gujarati folk songs such as garbas of Pavagadh from her maternal grandmother.</li>
                <li>Deenanath adopted the surname Mangeshkar in order to identify his family with his native town of
                    Mangeshi, Goa.</li>
                <li>Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female</li>
                <li> character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, भाव बंधन.</li>
                <li> She was the eldest child in the family. Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath, in birth order, are her
                    siblings;</li>
                <li> all are accomplished singers and musicians.</li>
                <li>She received her first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an
                    actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). </li>
                <li>On her first day of school, Mangeshkar left because she was not allowed to bring her sister Asha
                    along with her.</li>
